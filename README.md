🎬 Movie Rating Prediction Model - Internship Project at CodSoft

Overview
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on various features such as user preferences, movie genres, and historical rating data. The aim of the project is to provide accurate predictions of how users would rate movies, thereby enhancing personalized recommendations for streaming platforms or movie databases.

Key Components

Data Collection & Preprocessing 📊
The project involved gathering movie and user rating data from available datasets. Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalizing features, and transforming categorical data (like genres) into numerical format were crucial to prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Engineering & Selection 🔍
Critical features like user demographics, movie metadata (genre, director, cast), and previous ratings were selected to improve prediction accuracy. The feature engineering phase also included creating new features, such as genre popularity and user-specific behavior trends.

Model Building & Training 🧠
Several machine learning models were tested, including collaborative filtering approaches, regression models, and matrix factorization techniques. By leveraging both content-based and collaborative filtering methods, the model was able to learn patterns in the data and generalize well to unseen ratings.

Evaluation Metrics & Model Performance 📈
The model’s performance was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Cross-validation was employed to ensure the model’s robustness, and hyperparameter tuning was carried out to optimize performance.

Conclusion & Insights 💡
The model successfully captured key relationships between users and movies, enabling it to predict ratings with a high degree of accuracy. It was observed that user preferences, combined with movie genre and historical ratings, were the most influential factors in determining the final rating.
